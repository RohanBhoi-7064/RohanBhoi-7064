## Hello there 👋
I’m Rohan a full-stack engineer who loves building things from scratch, breaking them on purpose, and then fixing them in smarter ways. I work across frontend, backend, DevOps, and I’m steadily diving deeper into ethical hacking.

I started out writing simple web applications, moved into backend and API development, and eventually got pulled into automation, cloud, and pipelines. The more I explored, the more I realized security isn’t a separate skill it’s something that needs to be baked into everything we build.

I spend my time experimenting with new stacks, optimizing systems, and learning how attackers exploit weak spots so I can close them before they even exist.
And when I’m on stage, I love sharing these experiences breaking down complex topics into practical insights for developers and students.

Outside of work, I explore hacking labs, read about modern attack vectors, and occasionally lose track of time tweaking some random project.

📌 Feel free to browse through my repositories I’ve pinned the ones that reflect my journey the best.
Thanks for dropping by, fellow developer!
